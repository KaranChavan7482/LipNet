# LipNet ## Overview LipNet is a deep learning model designed for lipreading sentences in natural, unconstrained videos. The model is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically designed to decode the visual information from lip movements to recognize spoken phrases. This repository contains the implementation of LipNet along with tools for training, testing, and evaluating the model. 
## Features 
- **Lipreading in the Wild**: LipNet is capable of lipreading sentences in real-world scenarios, where speakers may vary in appearance, lighting conditions, and background noise.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: The model architecture combines CNNs for feature extraction from lip images and RNNs for sequence modeling and prediction.
- **Training Pipeline**: Tools for training the LipNet model using a dataset of labeled lip videos and corresponding transcripts.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluation scripts to assess the performance of LipNet using standard metrics such as word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER).
- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained weights for LipNet models, enabling quick deployment and testing. ## Installation To set up LipNet, follow these steps: 1. Clone this repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/KaranChavan7482/LipNet.git ``` 2. Install dependencies using pip: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 3. Download pre-trained models (optional): ``` ./download_models.sh ``` Feel free to adjust the content as needed to better fit your project's specifics!
